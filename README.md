When developing an iOS application, one might find it very hard to create
each and every part of the app from scratch. Thankfully there are many libraries
that can help a developer implement new features in a much more efficient manner.
@vsouza has curated a list of hundreds of these libraries for Swift and
Objective-c. I personally have used dozens of libraries from this list and I
think it is a vital asset to anyone looking to code their own apps with a very
small team.


The list can be found [here](https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios)
